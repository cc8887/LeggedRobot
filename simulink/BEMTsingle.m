%
%   This is based on the BEMT theory as described by Dr. J.Gordon Leishman
%   in his book "Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics
%
%
%   Purpose:    The aim of this code is to calculate the thrust and power
%               characteristics of a single rotor helicopter in hovering 
%               flight. This is done using Blade Element Momentum Theory
%               to calculate the inflow, thrust and power for each blade 
%               segment then sum them along the length of the blade.
%
%               This kind of analysis is useful for a preliminary rotary
%               winged vehicle, and has been used as the bases for an   
%               optimisation for vehicle design.
%
%   Inputs: -Applied Angle of Incidence of the blade (Angle between the
%           chordline and the horizontal) (deg)
%
%           -RPM of the rotor
%
%           -BladeCharacteristics Structure containing:
%               -BChar.Cla  = Cl/Alpha slope of airfoil (1/deg)
%               -BChar.Cd   = Drag Coefficient of blade at Angle of
%                             Incidence
%               -BChar.Nb   = Number of Blades
%               -BChar.c    = Blade Chord Length  (m)
%               -BChar.Rmax = Max Radius of Blade (m)
%               -BChar.Rmin = Root Cutout Length (m) 
%
%           -Number of Radial stations for calculation (n=100 is typical)
%
%
%   Outputs: [3x1 Vector, 2x1 Cell]
%               -[Thrust Generated, Power Required, Figure of Merit]
%               -[Radial Locations Vector, Non-Dimensional Inflow Vector]
